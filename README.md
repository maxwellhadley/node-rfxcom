Evented communication with RFXtrx433.
=====================================

To install
----------

<pre>
  npm install rfxcom
</pre>

Depends on serialport 4.* and queue ^4.0.0

To Use
------

<pre>
var rfxcom = require('rfxcom'),
    pg = require('pg').native,
    conString = "pg://user:password@localhost/user",
    client = new pg.Client(conString);

var rfxtrx = new rfxcom.RfxCom("/dev/ttyUSB0", {debug: true});

/*
 * This reports security updates from X10 security devices.
 */
rfxtrx.on("security1", function (evt) {
  if (evt.deviceStatus === rfxcom.security.MOTION) {
    console.log("Device %s %s detected motion.", evt.subtype, evt.id);
  } else if (evt.deviceStatus === rfxcom.security.NOMOTION) {
    console.log("Device %s %s reported motion stopped.", evt.subtype, evt.id);
  }
});

rfxtrx.on("elec2", function (evt) {
  // Requires a PostgreSQL table
  // CREATE TABLE energy (recorded_time timestamp DEFAULT NOW(),
  //                      device_id VARCHAR, current_watts FLOAT)
  client.query("INSERT INTO energy(device_id, current_watts) values($1, $2)",
                [evt.id, evt.currentWatts]);
});

rfxtrx.initialise(function () {
    console.log("Device initialised");
});
</pre>

Sending Commands
================

Prototype objects are provided for some of the most useful protocols (see the RFXCOM manual for details):

* Blinds1
* Chime1
* Curtain1
* Lighting1
* Lighting2
* Lighting3
* Lighting4
* Lighting5
* Lighting6
* Rfy

Each prototype has a constructor, most of which must be called with the required subtype as a second parameter.
The subtypes are exported from `index.js` and can be accessed as shown in the examples below. Each prototype has
functions to send the appropriate commands. File `DeviceCommands.md` contains a quick reference to all these transmitter
prototype objects.

Commands can only be sent when the RFXtrx433 is connected (see below). Commands are held in a queue, and will be sent as
soon as the RFXtrx433 can accept them. No commands are sent (and no messages received) until the initial handshake
with the RFXtrx433 is complete. If the RFXtrx433 is disconnected the queue is cleared, losing any command messages it
may contain.

LightwaveRf
-----------
LightwaveRf devices use the specialised Lighting5 prototype, which itself uses an RfxCom object.

<pre>
var rfxcom = require('rfxcom');

var rfxtrx = new rfxcom.RfxCom("/dev/ttyUSB0", {debug: true}),
    lightwaverf = new rfxcom.Lighting5(rfxtrx, rfxcom.lighting5.LIGHTWAVERF);

rfxtrx.initialise(function () {
  console.log("Device initialised");
  lightwaverf.switchOn("0xF09AC8/1", {mood: 0x03});
  lightwaverf.switchOn("0xF09AC8/2", {level: 0x10});
});
</pre>

I've tested it with both LightwaveRf lights, and the relay switch.

LightwaveRf lights get their identity from the remote used to pair, if you don't
have a remote, or if you want to specify the address manually, you can pair the
device by putting the device into pairing mode and turning on a chosen device id, for example lightwaverf.switchOn("0xFFFFFF/1").

The device ids don't have to be unique, but it's advisable.

HomeEasy (EU)
-------------
HomeEasy devices use the specialised Lighting2 prototype, which itself uses an RfxCom object. There are two types of
HomeEasy: the ones marketed in UK are of type 'AC', while those in the Netherlands and elsewhere are of type 'HOMEEASY_EU'.

<pre>
    var rfxtrx = new rfxcom.RfxCom("/dev/ttyUSB0", {debug: true}),
        lighting2 = new rfxcom.Lighting2(rfxtrx, rfxcom.lighting2.HOMEEASY_EU);

    lighting2.switchOn("0xF09AC8AA/1");
    lighting2.switchOff("0xF09AC8AA/1");
</pre>

Rfy (Somfy) Blinds
------------------
There is a specialised Rfy prototype, which itself uses an RfxCom object. This supports three subtypes: 'RFY', 'RFYEXT'
and 'ASA', one of which must be supplied to the Rfy constructor. RFY support requires an RFXtrx433E.

<pre>
    var rfxtrx = new rfxcom.RfxCom("/dev/ttyUSB0", {debug: true}),
           rfy = new rfxcom.Rfy(rfxtrx, rfxcom.rfy.RFY);

    rfy.up("0x10203/1");
    // All commands can take an optional callback
    rfy.down("0x10203/1", function(err, res, sequenceNumber) {
                if (!err) console.log('complete');
            });
    // The ID can be supplied as an array with address & unitcode elements (strings)
    rfy.do(["0x10203", "1"], "down");
    // The eraseAll() and listRemotes() commands DO NOT take an ID parameter, all the others do
    rfy.listRemotes();
    rfy.eraseAll(callback);
</pre>

Supported commands include standard operations such as up(), down(), and stop(), as well
as the programming commands:
program(), erase(), eraseAll(), and listRemotes().
All other commands can be accessed using the do() command - see the
RfyCommands list in defines.js for the complete list of available commands.

To 'pair' the RFX as a new remote control with a Somfy blind motor,
press and hold 'program' *on the existing Somfy remote controller* until the blind responds with a 'jog'
motion. Then send a program() command to the RFXtrx433E, with the ID parameter set to an address/unit code
combination of your choice - this needs to be unique within the RFXtrx433E's list, but is otherwise
arbitrary. Limits for the address are 0x1 to 0xFFFFF; limits for the unitcode are 0x0 to 0x4 for RFY
subtype devices, 0x0 to 0xf for RFYEXT devices, and 0x1 to 0x5 for ASA devices.

To list all the remotes (of either RFY or ASA subtype) send a listRemotes() command; to erase a single
entry from the list, send erase(ID) where ID is the address/unitcode of the entry to erase; or eraseAll()
to clear the list.

RfxCom system events
====================

System events are used to track conection & disconnection of, and communication with, the RFXtrx433 itself,
and to provide low-level access to received data (including unsupported packet types)

"connecting"
------------
Emitted when the RFXcom has successfully opened the serial port.

"connectfailed"
------------
Emitted if the RFXcom was unable to open the serial port.

"ready"
-------
Emitted when the RFXtrx433 is ready to accept data (after a delay to prevent it from entering the bootloader).

"disconnect"
------------
Emitted if the RFXtrx433 has been disconnected from the USB port

"response"
----------
Emitted when a response message is received from the RFXtrx 433, or RfxCom times out waiting for a response.
It passes three parameters:
* A textual description of the response, as a string
* The sequence number of the message responded to
* A response code number:
  - 0: ACK - transmit OK
  - 1: ACK - transmit delayed
  - 2: NAK - transmitter did not lock onto frequency
  - 3: NAK - AC address not allowed
  - 4: Command unknown or not supported by this device
  - 5: Unknown RFY remote ID
  - 6: Timed out waiting for response

"listremotes"
-------------
Emitted in response to the Rfy command `listRemotes()` - this queries the RFXtrx433E for the list of currently stored
simulated RFY remote controls. The list is passed an array, which may be of zero length, of objects describing each
simulated remote control:
* remoteNumber: index number of this entry in the RFXtrx433E's internal list
* remoteType: "RFY" or "ASA",
* deviceId: Address/unitcode as a hexadecimal string, e.g. "0x123/2"
* idBytes: Address as an array of 3 bytes, e.g. [0x00, 0x01, 0x23]
* unitCode: Unit code as a byte, e.g. 0x02

This event is emitted approximately 10s after the `listRemotes()` command is given, as the only way to detect the end of
the list is to wait for the response timeout - the RFXtrx433E does not send an 'end of list' packet.

"status"
--------
Emitted when a "status" message is received from the RFXtrx 433.

"end"
--------
Emitted when the serial port "ends".

"drain"
--------
Emitted when the serial port emits a "drain" event.

"receive"
---------
Emitted when any packet message is received from the RFXtrx 433, and passes the raw bytes that were received, as an
array of bytes. This event is emitted before the received data event for the packet type (if one is defined). 

RfxCom received data events - sensors
=====================================

The events are mostly named from the message identifiers used in the RFXtrx documentation. A protocol must
be enabled to be received. This can be done using RFXmngr.exe, or the `enable()` function of the rfxcom object.
Each event passes an object whose properties contain the received sensor data, along with signal strength and
battery level (if available).

"security1"
-----------
Emitted when an X10 or similar security device reports a status change.

"bbq1"
------
Emitted when a message is received from a Maverick ET-732 BBQ temperature sensor.

"temprain1"
-----------
Emitted when a message is received from an Allecto temperature/rainfall weather sensor.

"temp1" - "temp11"
-----------------
Emitted when a message is received from a temperature sensor (inside/outside air temperature; pool water temperature).

"humidity1"
-----------
Emitted when data arrives from humidity sensing devices

"th1" - "th14"
-------------
Emitted when a message is received from Oregon Scientific and other
temperature/humidity sensors.

"thb1" - "thb2"
---------------
Emitted when a message is received from an Oregon Scientific
temperature/humidity/barometric pressure sensor.

"rain1" - "rain7"
-----------------
Emitted when data arrives from rainfall sensing devices

"wind1" - "wind7"
-----------------
Emitted when data arrives from wind speed/direction sensors

"uv1" - "uv3"
-------------
Emiied when data arrives from ultraviolet radiation sensors

"weight1" - "weight2"
---------------------
Emitted when a message is received from a weighing scale device.

"elec1" - "elec5"
-----------------
Emitted when data is received from OWL or REVOLT electricity monitoring devices.

"rfxmeter"
----------
Emitted whan a message is received from an RFXCOM rfxmeter device.

"rfxsensor"
-----------
Emitted when a message is received from an RFXCOM rfxsensor device.

RfxCom received data events - remote controls
=============================================

These events are emitted when data arrives from a 'remote control' device, which may be a pushbutton
unit or a dedicated remote control device such as a PIR light switch. The events are named from the
message identifiers used in the RFXtrx documentation. A protocol must be enabled to be received. however not
every protocol that can be transmitted can be received. Each event passes an object whose properties contain
the received command, along with signal strength and battery level (if available).

"lighting1"
-----------
Emitted when a message is received from X10, ARC, Energenie or similar lighting remote control devices.

"lighting2"
-----------
Emitted when a message is received from AC/HomeEasy type remote control devices.

"lighting4"
-----------
Emitted when a message is received from devices using the PT2262 family chipset.

"lighting5"
-----------
Emitted when a message is received from LightwaveRF/Siemens type remote control devices.

"lighting6"
-----------
Emitted when a message is received from Blyss lighting remote control devices.

"blinds1"
--------
Emitted when a message arrives from a compatible type 1 blinds remote controller (only a few subtypes can be received)

"chime1"
--------
Emitted when data arrives from Byron or similar doorbell pushbutton

Connecting and disconnecting
============================
The function `rfxtrx.initialise()` will attempt to connect to the RFXtrx433 hardware. If this succeeds, a 'connecting' event
is emitted, followed about 5.5 seconds later by a 'ready' event. If the device is not present (wrong device path, or device
not plugged in) a 'connectfailed' event is emitted. If the the hardware is subsequently unplugged, a 'disconnect' event
is emitted (this can also happen before either the 'connecting' or 'ready' events are emitted).

If either the connection fails or the RFXtrx433 is unplugged, a subsequent call to `initialise()` will attempt to reconnect.
Your 'disconnect'/'connectfailed' handler may make repeated attempts to reconnect,
but <em>must</em> allow an interval of at least `rfxcom.initialiseWaitTime` milliseconds between each attempt. While
disconnected, any data sent by a call to a command object is silently discarded, however the various received data event
handlers are preserved.

<em>Note:</em>

Some variants of Linux will create a differently-named device file if the RFtxr433 is disconnected and then reconnected,
even if it is reconnected to the same USB port. For example, `/dev/ttyUSB0` may become `/dev/ttyUSB1`. To avoid any
problems this may cause, use the equivalent alias device file in `/dev/serial/by-id/` when creating the RfxCom object.
This should look something like `/dev/serial/by-id/usb_RFXCOM_RFXtrx433_12345678-if00-port0`.
