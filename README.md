No Longer Maintained as of 2017-07-01
-------------------------------------

As I am now a member of the 'rfxcom' organisation maintaining the original repository at
https://github.com/rfxcom/node-rfxcom, this fork is no longer being maintained. I am leaving it
place for purposes of historical record.

Please head on over to the rfxcom repository & join in the fun!
